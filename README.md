2E Rocket - Extremely extra fancy new tab page

### Why this?
- As is: A blank new tab page :D
- To be: A place you can trust for things you often use instead of having to google or remember random sites

### Prerequisites
- It's a TypeScript project, do anything yourself to make it work ^^
### Usage
- Firstly, BUILD
- From the Chrome extension manager, turn on developer mode, and import the `build` folder.
- Play!


### TODO
- [ ] Rewrite this README if needed
- [ ] Add to this TODO the features we want (We currently don't want a backend)
    - Whatever increase your productivity (Todo list, utility toolbox, etc.)
    - Customizable design
